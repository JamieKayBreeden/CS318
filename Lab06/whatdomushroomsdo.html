<h1>What Do Mushrooms Do?</h1>
<p>They can do many things, which are beneficial to all living things. They are the biggest decomposers in the carbon cycle, and provide life sustaining minerals to plants, so that they may do their part too. However, some are capable of decomposing living organisms, which can lead to a parasitic relationship that ends in death. Observe how this cordyceps fungus infects an ant.</p>
