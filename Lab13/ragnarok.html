<h4>Stanzas 40-58</h4>
<p>The giantess old | in Ironwood sat,<br>
    In the east, and bore | the brood of Fenrir;<br>
    Among these one | in monster's guise<br>
    Was soon to steal | the sun from the sky.</p>
<p>There feeds he full | on the flesh of the dead,<br>
    And the home of the gods | he reddens with gore;<br>
    Dark grows the sun, | and in summer soon<br>
    Come mighty storms: | would you know yet more?</p>
<p>On a hill there sat, | and smote on his harp,<br>
    Eggther the joyous, | the giants' warder;<br>
    Above him the cock | in the bird-wood crowed,<br>
    Fair and red | did Fjalar stand.<br>
    Then to the gods | crowed Gollinkambi,<br>
    He wakes the heroes | in Othin's hall;<br>
    And beneath the earth | does another crow,<br>
    The rust-red bird | at the bars of Hel.</p>
<p>Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,<br>
    The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;<br>
    Much do I know, | and more can see<br>
    Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.</p>
<p>Brothers shall fight | and fell each other,<br>
    And sisters' sons | shall kinship stain;<br>
    Hard is it on earth, | with mighty whoredom;<br>
    Axe-time, sword-time, | shields are sundered,<br>
    Wind-time, wolf-time, | ere the world falls;<br>
    Nor ever shall men | each other spare.</p>
<p>Fast move the sons | of Mim, and fate<br>
    Is heard in the note | of the Gjallarhorn;<br>
    Loud blows Heimdall, | the horn is aloft,<br>
    In fear quake all | who on Hel-roads are.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil shakes, | and shiver on high<br>
    The ancient limbs, | and the giant is loose;<br>
    To the head of Mim | does Othin give heed,<br>
    But the kinsman of Surt | shall slay him soon.</p>
<p>How fare the gods? | how fare the elves?<br>
    All Jotunheim groans, | the gods are at council;<br>
    Loud roar the dwarfs | by the doors of stone,<br>
    The masters of the rocks: | would you know yet more?</p>
<p>Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,<br>
    The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free<br>
    Much do I know, | and more can see<br>
    Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.</p>
<p>From the east comes Hrym | with shield held high;<br>
    In giant-wrath | does the serpent writhe;<br>
    O'er the waves he twists, | and the tawny eagle<br>
    Gnaws corpses screaming; | Naglfar is loose.</p>
<p>O'er the sea from the east | there sails a ship<br>
    With the people of Muspell, | at the helm stands Loki;<br>
    After the wolf | do wild men follow,<br>
    And with them the brother | of Byleist goes.</p>
<p>Surt fares from the south | with the scourge of branches,<br>
    The sun of the battle-gods | shone from his sword;<br>
    The crags are sundered, | the giant-women sink,<br>
    The dead throng Hel-way, | and heaven is cloven.</p>
<p>Now comes to Hlin | yet another hurt,<br>
    When Othin fares | to fight with the wolf,<br>
    And Beli's fair slayer | seeks out Surt,<br>
    For there must fall | the joy of Frigg.</p>
<p>Then comes Sigfather's | mighty son,<br>
    Vithar, to fight | with the foaming wolf;<br>
    In the giant's son | does he thrust his sword<br>
    Full to the heart: | his father is avenged.</p>
<p>Hither there comes | the son of Hlothyn,<br>
    The bright snake gapes | to heaven above;<br>
    . . . . . . . . . .<br>
    Against the serpent | goes Othin's son.</p>
<p>In anger smites | the warder of earth,--<br>
    Forth from their homes | must all men flee;-<br>
    Nine paces fares | the son of Fjorgyn,<br>
    And, slain by the serpent, | fearless he sinks.</p>
<p>The sun turns black, | earth sinks in the sea,<br>
    The hot stars down | from heaven are whirled;<br>
    Fierce grows the steam | and the life-feeding flame,<br>
    Till fire leaps high | about heaven itself.</p>
<p>Now Garm howls loud | before Gnipahellir,<br>
    The fetters will burst, | and the wolf run free;<br>
    Much do I know, | and more can see<br>
    Of the fate of the gods, | the mighty in fight.</p>
