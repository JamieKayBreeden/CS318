<h2>Despite what you may have heard, sharks are not mindless killing machines.</h2>
<p>As a matter of fact, they are incredibly important to the ocean's ecosystem, and are quite harmless to humans. They are one of the most misunderstood creatures. Because of this, they have become a target of poachers and shark fin hunters. Many people don't understand that sharks are not monsters.</p>
<h3>Here's why you need to care about sharks.</h3>
<ul><li>They keep unwanted predator populations at bay</li>
    <li>They serve as an indicator of the ocean's health</li>
    <li>Sharks could be the future of advancing modern day medicine</li>
    <li>They are one of the few species that have not undergone major evolutionary changes</li>
    <li>Sharks balance the ocean's ecosystem, and are protecting coral reefs</li>
    </ul>

<h2>What can you do to assist sharks?</h2>
<p>The first step is education. Learn about what sharks really are, and unlearn your hatred and fear. Once you take this first step, you will understand that sharks are important, and not evil. Yes, there are cases of sharks harming people, but the statistics are highly misrepresented, and are typically accidental. As a matter of fact, before the movie "Jaws" was released, shark attacks were actually called "shark accidents". Once you are fully educated on sharks, go out there, and fight for them! Another task you can do to help sharks, is donating to shark rescues, and supporting organizations that help sharks.</p>
